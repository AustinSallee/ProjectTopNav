CS360 GPS Project

"Incoming freshmen and transfer students sometimes find it difficult to locate classrooms during their first few semesters on campus. This project consists of developing a mobile software tool which allows students to find their way to a specific classroom on WKU's campus based on their current location. The classroom finder should use the GPS location of the student, along with other environmental variables, to navigate them towards a specific classroom. The project group should determine if the classroom finder will be developed using Android, iOS, or both."
